    "   #### Libraries used: \n",
    "   * slate3k - To read PDF files as text in Python \n",
    "   * re - To use regular expressions in Python\n",
    "   * pandas - To make use of Pandas dataframes for ease of use in computation\n",

    "   Regular Expressions were extensively used to extract and clean the data. \n",
